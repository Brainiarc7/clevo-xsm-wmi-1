### Additions over tuxedo-wmi
* Sysfs interface to control the brightness, mode, colour,
  on/off state after the module has loaded.
  In the original code you can only set these before the module loads.
* Small application to visually control the keyboard lighting using the sysfs
  interface.
* Mode key cycles through colours.
